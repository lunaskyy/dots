# dots

##### note: i'm using `archinstall` in my dots for sake of simplicity and relative repeatability, as far as i know it still has a pretty large security flaw, it is understood that during the install process, archinstall logs the user and (if setup) luks password, which even after deletion, could be recoverable by malicious software.

a workaround for now could be to set a `changeme` or other password at install time, and changing them after? - unsure about the security implications of changing the password though, i'll need to do more research on luks
